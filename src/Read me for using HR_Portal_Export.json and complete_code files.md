## Read me for using HR_Portal_Export.json and complete_code.py

This file is direct export of my Lex bot using console.
You can import the same using the following steps mentioned in the link.

Before you import change the lambda function ARN to one you created using complete_code.py
arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789876:function:hr_portal-hook
